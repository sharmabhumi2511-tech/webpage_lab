    <h2>ELECTRONIC AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING</h2>
    <P>
        Electronics and Communication Engineering works on various applications,
         including transmitting information across mediums, such as co-axial cables, 
         optical fibers, or free space. They design transmitters, receivers, and transceivers, 
         considering power consumption and signal strength. Electronics and Communication Engineering deals with analog and digital communication,
          signal processing, antenna and wave propagations, circuits, design and development of communication systems, and the network signal analog to digital signals.
